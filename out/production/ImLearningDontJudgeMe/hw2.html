					<p class="custom-font">Exhaustion: One of the defining features of the Berserker is the Frenzy ability, which grants an extra attack but inflicts exhaustion after the ability ends. Exhaustion is a severe condition in D&D, and accruing too much of it can have detrimental effects on a character's performance. Many players avoid Frenzy because they want to avoid the drawbacks of exhaustion.</p>

					<p class="custom-font">Lack of Utility: While the Berserker is excellent in combat and excels at dealing damage, it offers relatively little in terms of utility or versatility. Other Barbarian subclasses, like the Totem Warrior or the Ancestral Guardian, provide more varied and useful abilities that extend beyond pure damage-dealing.</p>

					<p class="custom-font">Roleplay Challenges: Roleplaying a Berserker character can be challenging for some players, as it often involves portraying a character who is constantly in a state of battle frenzy and may struggle with social interactions or strategic thinking. This can limit the depth of character development and roleplay opportunities.</p>

					<p class="custom-font">Versatility: The Totem Warrior subclass is highly versatile. Each totem option grants unique abilities that cater to different playstyles. For example, the Bear Totem provides enhanced durability, while the Eagle Totem offers mobility and scouting abilities. This versatility allows players to adapt their Barbarian to different situations and party compositions.</p>

					<p class="custom-font">Survivability: Totem Warriors are known for their exceptional durability. The Bear Totem, in particular, grants resistance to all types of damage except psychic, making Totem Warriors incredibly resilient in combat. This makes them excellent front-line tanks and damage sponges.</p>

					<p class="custom-font">Support: Totem Warriors can also support their party members. The Wolf Totem, for instance, grants advantage on attack rolls against creatures within 5 feet of the Totem Warrior, benefiting both the Barbarian and their allies. This support aspect enhances teamwork and party dynamics.</p>

					<p class="custom-font">Tank and Support Role: The Ancestral Guardian excels in the roles of tank and support. They can reduce the damage dealt to their allies by using their Spirit Shield ability to redirect incoming damage to themselves. This makes them excellent at protecting the party and keeping vulnerable members safe.</p>

					<p class="custom-font">Crowd Control: Ancestral Guardians have several features that impose disadvantage on enemies trying to attack their allies. This crowd control aspect can be invaluable in battles, helping to control the battlefield and mitigate threats.</p>

					<p class="custom-font">Team Player: Ancestral Guardians are team-oriented, making them valuable additions to a group. Their abilities are designed to benefit the entire party, fostering a sense of camaraderie and cooperation.</p>
